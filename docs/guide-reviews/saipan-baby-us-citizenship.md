# Saipan newborn citizenship — golden-reference acceptance
Golden reference: /guides/egg-freezing-cost/
Primary question: Is a Baby Born in Saipan a U.S. Citizen?
First-screen answer: Generally, yes. Section 303 of the CNMI Covenant provides citizenship at birth for people born in the CNMI on or after November 4, 1986; diplomatic exceptions and specific circumstances require attention.
Sources: U.S. Department of State 8 FAM 302.2-6, 2026 Supreme Court Trump v. Barbara opinion, DOS Visitor Visa rules, CBP pregnancy entry FAQ, DOS child passport, USCIS petitions.
Comparison: Compared both actual screenshot outputs from PR visual-review action #4, desktop 1440×900 and mobile 390×844, all three locales against egg-freezing-cost golden reference; reviewed 2026-10-28.

| Dimension | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Five-second answer | Better | Mobile screenshot begins with H1 and teal answer immediately after header; unlike the golden reference its image and navigation do not precede the direct answer. |
| Information density | Equal | Decision cards replace repetitive prose; the legal update has its own short notice next to the answer. |
| Visual clarity | Equal | Desktop screenshot shows responsive two-column photo/text hero, clean serif headlines and restrained spacing; mobile screenshot shows single-column layout without clipping. |
| Structured usefulness | Better | Four decisions, three-step newborn documentation path, four-item predeparture checklist and five expandable FAQs directly serve citizenship intent. |
| Specificity | Equal | Section 303 date, US Supreme Court ruling date and petition age 21 are explicitly scoped, primary-sourced; no invented fees or clinic success figures. |
| Trust | Equal | DOS, CBP, USCIS and Supreme Court sources; Pexels photographer, source photo and commercial-use licensing; editorial update metadata and clear nonlegal-advice caution. |
| User journey | Equal | Localized all-guides navigation, existing family-planning internal link and visible email contact in the footer. |
| Accessibility and responsive behavior | Equal | Actual mobile screenshots of all three languages; image dimensions, alt, semantic heading order, responsive cards and keyboard-native FAQ details. |
| Technical SEO | Equal | One H1, canonical per language, three real alternate routes, x-default English, sitemap special-guide mapping, shared Website/WebPage/Breadcrumb schema. |
| Localization | Better | Independent English, Simplified Chinese and Taiwan-oriented Traditional Chinese text; Taiwan guidance distinguishes nationality from passport and household registration. |

## Screenshot and test evidence
- GitHub Actions visual-review run #4: https://github.com/COLDDCC/saipanivf/actions/runs/40618438616
- Artifact `guide-visual-review`, ID 12786132712, screenshots: `en-desktop.png`, `en-mobile.png`, `zh-cn-desktop.png`, `zh-cn-mobile.png`, `zh-hant-desktop.png`, `zh-hant-mobile.png`, `golden-desktop.png`, `golden-mobile.png`.
- I inspected both new and golden reference mobile and desktop screenshots. The first mobile screenshot surfaced an image-first issue; this was corrected in commit 1ba6a3db89ca62fd716dd53dec03cb081af0e9cb and visually checked using the above artifact.
- Build and CI results must be checked separately against this review's head SHA; code and screenshot acceptance do not establish production deployment.
